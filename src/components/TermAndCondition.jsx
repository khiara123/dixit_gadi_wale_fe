      <p>
        To rent a bike or car in Mathura, customers must book through our website or verified WhatsApp channel. Bookings for chauffeur-driven cars, self-drive cars, and vintage wedding cars must be confirmed with full or partial payment. Upon confirmation, a booking ID and service details will be emailed to the registered address.

      <h5>2. Vehicle Pickup & Return in Mathura</h5>
      <p>
        Vehicles can be picked up from our designated locations in Mathura or delivered to specific addresses within city limits.

      <p>
        Renters must submit a valid driver's license and one government-issued ID proof (Aadhaar, Voter ID, or Passport) to rent a car or bike in Mathura. For vintage car bookings, an additional verification step is required due to the high value and unique usage.
